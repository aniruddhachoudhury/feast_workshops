#Feast Workshops 

### What is Feast?

[Feast](https://feast.dev/) is an operational data system for managing and serving machine learning features to 
models in production. It can serve features from a low-latency offline store (for real-time prediction) 
or from an off-line store (for scale-out batch scoring or training models).

Feature stores have emerged as a pivotal component in the modern machine learning stack, as more data scientists 
and engineers work together to operationalize ML. Associated with this task are some operational challenges. 
The toughest challenges for operationalizing ML is data: how to compute and select features, store, 
validate serve, discover and share them.

### Goal and Objective
In this series of lectures and workshops, where we have divided them into modules, you will learn:

* what key problems feature stores solve to operationalize ML
* why features stores are a pivotal components in the model machine learning stack
* common key use cases and deployment patterns for feature stores observed by the MLOps and ML practitioners
* how feature stores are playing a transformational role with the rise of modern data platforms
* get a hands-on experience with the popular open source feature store Feast

### About Workshop Module 1

In this module_1, we will cover:
 * Introduction to Feature Stores
   * what are they, what problems they solve, and why you need them
   * What is Feast and why
   * Key concepts in Feast
     * Projects
     * Feast Repos
     * Data Source
     * Entity
     * Features and Features Views
     * Feature Service
     * Offline & Online Stores
   * Learn Feast APIs
     * Declare and define Feast Object using Feast Declarative APIs
     * Use an IDE, Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook demonstrating how to uss Feast APIs
     
### Prerequisites
 * Knowledge of Python 3 and programming in general
 * Preferably a UNIX-based, fully-charged laptop with 8-16 GB, with a Chrome or Firefox browser
 * Some knowledge of Machine Learning concepts, libraries, and frameworks:
   * scikit-learn
   * pandas and Numpy
   * PyCharm/IntelliJ or choice of syntax-based Python editor
 * pip/pip3 or conda and Python 3 installed
 * Loads of virtual laughter, curiosity, and a sense of humor ... :-)

### Obtaining the Workshop materials
Familiarity with **git** is important so that you can get all the material easily during the tutorial and
workshop as well as continue to work in your free time, after the session is over.

``` git clone git@github.com:dmatrix/feast_workshops.git```

``` git clone https://github.com/dmatrix/feast_workshops.git```
